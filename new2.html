                 Many animal activists believe organised gangs are behind the theft and kidnapping of dogs in Delhi and NCR.
                 They say areas such as Trilokpuri, Nizamuddin, Shadipur, Sangam Vihar and Raangpuri Pahari are home to ‘puppy mills’ with cruel breeding practices.

                <p>
                 Where is my dog? This is one question an increasing number of dog owners in Delhi and NCR are asking these days.
                 And they are not getting any definitive answer.
                </p>

                <p>
                They fear their missing dogs may have been stolen for illegal breeding rampant in what animal activists call the 
                growing number of ‘puppy mills’ in many parts of the city.

                One such owner is Venu Rajamony, Press Secretary to the President of India. His pet a purebred female Dalmatian—disappeared
                in April from his residence at Talkatora Road.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                The family ran a campaign on social media, put up missing-dog posters and approached the police and the New Delhi Municipal 
                Council (NDMC), but to no avail. “We were preparing to take our pet to the Netherlands when it went missing,” says Rajamony,
                who is moving to the Netherlands next month as India’s Ambassador. “I see only two possibilities: either someone has found it 
                and kept it innocently not knowing what to do. The second is trafficking; many purebred dogs are used for illegal breeding.
                We mentioned in the posters that our pet is neutered.”
